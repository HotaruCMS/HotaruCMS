Disqus Plugin for Hotaru CMS
--------------------------------
Created by: Nick Ramsay

Description
-----------
A very basic plugin to enable comments with Disqus (http://disqus.com/). It doesn't support importing comments and there's no integration between Hotaru users and Disqus users.

Instructions
------------
1. Upload the "disqus" folder to your plugins folder. 
2. Install it from Plugin Management in Admin. 
3. Add your Disqus "short name" in the Settings page.

Known Issues
------------
The comment count link, e.g. "3 comments" will show zero if the url doesn't match the url that the first comment was posted on. Therefore, switching between friendly and standard urls will reset the counter for all previous posts. This doesn't remove comments, just the comment count.
