User Rankings Plugin for Hotaru CMS
-----------------------------------
Created by: Nick Ramsay

Description
-----------
A Widget and Page that ranks users by activity over the last X days. Comes with a settings page so you can customize the number of points to award for each post, comment or vote, and a cache duration to set how often points are updated.

Instructions
------------
1. Upload the "user_rankings" folder to your plugins folder.
2. Install it from Plugin Management in Admin.
3. Configure in Admin -> Plugin Settings -> User Rankings
4. Enable the User Rankings widget in Admin -> Plugin Settings -> Widgets

Note
----
Both the widget and page use the HTML cache so if you change a setting you will probably need to clear the HTML cache from Admin -> Maintenance.
