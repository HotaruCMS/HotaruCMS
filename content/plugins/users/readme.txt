Users Plugin for Hotaru CMS
--------------------------------
Created by: Nick Ramsay

Description
-----------
Allow users to register, with ReCaptcha and email confirmation anti-spam methods included. Users also provides user profile, settings and permission pages.

Instructions
------------
1. Upload the "users" folder to your plugins folder. Install it from Plugin Management in Admin.

Known bugs
----------
[Minor] When installing the plugin, you might be thrown out of the Plugin Management page and land on the Admin Home page. That happens because the Users plugin manages your permissions and while it installs itself, it doesn't know you have permission to view the Plugin Management page.
